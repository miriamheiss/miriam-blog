# Course Information
This was the second part of the First-year English writing course offered at Arizona State University. In this course, I learned how to write and research in a more academic environment, how to evaluate different sources, and how to utilize more modern writing technologies in academic writing situations.


## Community Advocacy and Palestine: Written Advocacy in Literature and Online

The final project was a research paper wherein I had to interview an advocate. I interviewed [Nora Lester Murad](https://noralestermurad.com/about/), an author and advocate for Palestine. I compared her work to Bisan Owda and Plestia Alaqad, two Palestinian advocates active on social media, who both engage in multiple forms of written advocacy.
