# Course Information
This course is Discovery and Discernment Through the Arts, offered at Brigham Young University Idaho. In the course I learned about the basic elements of visual art, music, literature, theatre, and film.

## Projects
### Greek Creation Story

I made a piece of art summarizing the Ancient Greek creation story, wrote a summary, and compared it to other creation stories, and how the story was affected by the environment and customs in Ancient Greece.
