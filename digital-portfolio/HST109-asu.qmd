## Course Information
This course is American History to 1865, offered by Arizona State University. I learned more about how to understand the complexity of American history on a global level.

### Projects
The projects in this class were "Museum Exhibits", where I would research a topic in great depth and choose 3 artifacts to present in a short slideshow.

#### 17th and 18th Century Cartography
In this project I explored different globes and maps that documented the how the British Empire was viewed in their own society, and how the Founders of the United States wanted to be different than Europe, and how they wanted to be percieved in the world.

#### Women's Liberation 1830-1850
In this project I researched women's history in the Antebellum period. There was an large industrialization of the country, and women started to turn away from the outdated ideals of earlier years. I also explore how women's fashion reflected and introduced the ideas of freedom in this era.
