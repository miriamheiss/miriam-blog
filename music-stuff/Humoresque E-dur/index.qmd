I wrote this piece shortly after completing my AP Music Theory course. It is one of my first multi-instrument pieces, and emulates the Humoresques by Antonín Dvořák, with a light sound and quick pace. It uses piano, violin, flute, and glockenspiel. This piece has not been recorded by any actual musicians, the recording produced is the automatic Musescore audio.
