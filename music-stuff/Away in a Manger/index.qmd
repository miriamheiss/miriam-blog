This song was written for the Young Women in my ward in 2024, using melodies from the Afton Water and Mueller hymn tunes of Away in a Manger. The final verse (starting at measure 80) uses lyrics found in the 6th verse of [How Firm a Foundation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/hymns/how-firm-a-foundation?lang=eng), using the Mueller tune.
