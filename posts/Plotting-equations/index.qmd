We know what a quadratic equation is:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

But what if we could actually *see* the answers, plotted out in a graph?

\ 

## Some equations

Before we can plot anything, we need an equation.

We will be plotting 4 equations. Here they are:

- $x^2 - 11r + 28$
- $x^2 - x + 46$
- $x^2 + 49$
- $x^2 -4x$

need to learn to do graph lol
