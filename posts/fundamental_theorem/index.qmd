## The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that "every one-variable polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ complex roots."

## Complex Roots

The standard form of a complex number is $a + bi$, $a$ being real and $bi$ being imaginary. All real roots are complex roots. This means numbers like $11$, $291$, and $3$ can all be roots. All real numbers are complex numbers, and all real roots are complex roots, because when $b = 0$, the number is equal to $a$. 

### Degree of 2

Let's look at this equation

$$
x^2 - 3x + 2
$$

The leading term ($x$ squared) has a degree of 2. If we graph this, we should have exactly 2 complex roots.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
q <- function(x) {
  x^2 - 3*x + 2
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = q, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

## The code
Here's the code behind the graph:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
q <- function(x) {
  x^2 - 3*x + 2
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = q, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

:::

We can see that the parabola intersects the x-axis at 1 and 2. These are our 2 complex roots! Roots, or zeros, are the intercepts on a graph, or the place where $y$ (or $x$ if the parabola is horizontal) is equal to zero.

### Degree of 3
#### All real roots

Let's use the equation

$$x^3-4x^2+2x+3$$
This is a cubic polynomial (a polynomial with degree $3$), which means it will have exactly 3 roots.

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
q <- function(x) {
  x^3 - 4*x^2 + 2*x +3
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = q, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

::: {.callout-note collapse=true icon=false}
## The code
Here's the code behind the graph:

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
v <- function(x) {
  x^3 - 4*x^2 + 2*x +3
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = v, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

:::

The roots here all pass through the x-axis, and the various intercepts/zeros are $-0.6$, $1.6$, and $3$. But a cubic polynomial passing through the x-axis all three times isn't always the case.

## Odd degree polynomials

A polynomial with an odd degree **must** have at least 1 real root. Nonreal roots come in conjugate pairs, which means that there would be an even number 

When something is a conjugate pair, you flip the sign of the imaginary term. Subtraction becomes addition, addition becomes subtraction.

$a+bi$ is the conjugate of $a - bi$

We can write conjugate pairs like $a\pm bi$

### Nonreal Roots with odd degree polynomials

$$
2x^3 - 5x^2 + 3x +4
$$
This equation is a cubic polynomial. Let's graph this:

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
f <- function(x) {
  2*x^3 - 5*x^2 + 3*x +4
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = f, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
f <- function(x) {
  2*x^3 - 5*x^2 + 3*x +4
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = f, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +

       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

:::

The cubic polynomial only passes through the x-axis one time. The "down-up" part of the graph has no intercepts. These two roots are nonreal. The roots for this equation are $0.5$ and $\approx1.5 \pm 0.97i$

::: {.callout-important}

Nonreal roots ALWAYS come in conjugate pairs

:::

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
t <- function(x) {
  2*x^3 - 5*x^2 + 3*x +4
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4.2, alpha = 0.4, color = "blue")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = t, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

We can draw a different line for the x-intercepts that are higher up. This shows that they are roots, they just don't pass through the x-axis.

## Even degree polynomials
### Real roots with even degree polynomials
Parabolasâ€”being to the 2nd power, can only have 2 roots. This means that both of them are real, or both of them are nonreal. Quartic polynomials are a little bit different. They can either have all real, 2 real, or none real. Let's take a look at this quartic polynomial.

$$x^4-2x^3-3x^2+5x+1$$

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
m <- function(x) {
  x^4-2*x^3-3*x^2+5*x+1
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = m, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```

The roots here are $-1.6$, $-0.2$, $0.5$, and $2.3$. We have exactly 4, and all of them are real.

### Nonreal roots with even degree polynomials
#### All nonreal

$$x^4-1x^3-3x^2+3x+7$$
This polynomial has degree 4, so it will have 4 roots.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
g <- function(x) {
  x^4-1*x^3-3*x^2+3*x+7
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = g, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```
As you can see, no lines intersect the x-axis, and none of the roots are real. The roots here are $\approx-1.3\pm0.6i$ and $\approx1.7\pm0.9i$

#### Some nonreal

We can go through the same process for a graph that produces 2 real and 2 nonreal roots

$$x^4-x^3-4x^2+x-3$$


```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
h <- function(x) {
  x^4-x^3-4*x^2+x-3
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = h, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```
The roots here are $-2$, $2.5$, with the conjugate pair $\approx 0.1\pm0.7i$

## Multiplicity

Multiplicity occurs when a line "bounces" off of the x (or y) axis. Let me show you what I mean...

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
w <- function(x) {
  x^4-2.2*x^3-3*x^2+2*x+2
}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = w, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5)
  )
```
In this graph, the first "down-up" doesn't technically intersect the x axis, but it's also not floating around elsewhere. This is a **double root**. Double roots are pretty much the same things as multiplicity.

### Double Roots

When we find the roots of any polynomial, we are simplifying it. Here's an example of a quartic polynomial equation with a double root (not simplified)

$$f(x) = x^4+3x^3-17x^2-39x-20$$
We can start factoring and simplifying to find the roots

## Synthetic division

This is not a super in-depth tutorial on how to do synthetic division, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. Synthetic division is a *really* cool trick that uses the coefficients of a polynomial to divide and factor. The coefficients of this polynomial are $1$, $3$, $-17$, $-39$, and $-20$. You line up your coefficients in the order they appear in the equation, like so:

$$\begin{array}{rrrrr}
1 & 3 & -17 & -39 & -20 \\
\end{array}$$

After that, you are then ready to start "dividing". 

$0$, $1$, and $-1$ are always good numbers to start with

$$\begin{array}{c|rrrrr}
0 & 1 & 3 & -17 & -39 & -20 \\
 & & 0 & 0 & -13 & 0 \\
\hline
& 1 & 3 & -17 & -39 & -20\\
\end{array}$$
 
You put the starting number in front of all your lined up coefficients and drag down the first coefficient 2 lines. Then, you multiply and add across ($1*0  = 0$, $3 + 0 = 3$, $3*0 = 0$, $-17+0 = -17$, etc.) The very last number is what the "root" is, and we want that number to be $0$. Eventually, continuing with 0 as the starting number, we get $f(0)=-20$, which is not a root. We do the same thing with $1$.

$$\begin{array}{c|rrrrr}
1 & 1 & 3 & -17 & -39 & -20 \\
 & & 1 & 4 & -13 & -52 \\
\hline
& 1 & 4 & -13 & -52 & -72\\
\end{array}$$

Not a root. What about $-1$?

$$\begin{array}{c|rrrrr}
-1 & 1 & 3 & -17 & -39 & -20 \\
 & & -1 & -2 & 19 & 20 \\
\hline
& 1 & 2 & -19 & -20 & 0\\
\end{array}$$

Huzzah! We have a root! We need 4 though, so we press on. We can't use the same polynomial that we were using before though, the numbers at the bottom (not including the $0$) make our new polynomial. We start 1 degree lower, so the leading term is to the power of 3. We also need to keep that $-1$ somewhere, which is where the factoring comes in. We can write our new polynomial multiplied by $(x+1)$, so when it's multiplied out, we keep the same $f(x)$.

Our new polynomial is $(x+1)(x^3 + 2x^2-19x-20)$, so we list the coefficients again:

$$\begin{array}{rrrr}
1 & 2 & -19 & -20 \\
\end{array}$$

And go through the multiplication and addition again:

$$\begin{array}{c|rrrr}
-1 & 1 & 2 & -19 & -20 \\
 & & -1 & -1 & 20 \\
\hline
& 1 & 1 & -20 & 0 \\
\end{array}$$

I started with $-1$ because I already knew that it was a root, in different equations it does require a little bit more trial and error. We have another root! Our new polynomial is $(x+1)(x+1)(x^2+x-20)$. The quadratic factors down into $(x-4)(x+5)$, so our fully factored polynomial is:

$$
f(x) = 
x^4+3x^3-17x^2-39x-20 = 
(x+1)^2(x-4)(x+5)
$$
The double root is $(x+1)$, or $-1$.

This means that all of the roots are $-1$, $-1$, $4$, and $-5$.

## Faster way to get the roots

You can do the factoring and simplification by hand with synthetic division. Or you can make your life just a little bit easier and make the computer do it:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
k <- function(x) {x^4+3*x^3-17*x^2-39*x-20}

k(1)
k(0)
k(4)
k(-5)
k(-1)
```
And here's the graph!

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
k <- function(x) {x^4+3*x^3-17*x^2-39*x-20}

ggplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_function(fun = k, color = "red") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-50, 10)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = c(-10, 10))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -50:10, limits = c(-50, 10))+
  labs(x = "X",
       y = "Y")+
  theme_linedraw()+
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  )
```

This is a very large quartic polynomial, and goes all the way down to -135, which is why it cuts off in some places. The only place that really matters for our purposes today is the x axis, and you are able to see where the line crosses and bounces off the x axis.

## Review

Here are key points about the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra

* If the degree is $n$ there will be exactly $n$ roots
* All real roots are complex roots, all real numbers are complex numbers
* Nonreal roots come in pairs
* Polynomials with an odd degree **must** have at least 1 real root
* If the root crosses over or bounces off the x (or y) axis, it is real
* If the root is elsewhere, it is nonreal
