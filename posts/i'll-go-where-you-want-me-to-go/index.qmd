I have been very excited about the new [Hymns for Home and Church](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/collections/hymns-for-home-and-church?lang=eng), and so I have been organizing my music that I bring to church differently. I filled a binder with all the new hymns, and will continue to update that as they are released, and I have prelude and postlude music with it as well. Inspired by various [General Conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP6J5UPSalM) and firesides, I decided to create [harmonized last verses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_verse_harmonisation) to add to my mega-binder of music.
