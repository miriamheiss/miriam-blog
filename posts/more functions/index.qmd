plotting already but with just quadratic equations. maybe a review

what about multiple variables???

x and y

standard form for a circle is BLAH

we cannot use standard form while making our function. Otherwise the radius is counted as negative. we have to subtract the "constant" term. heres how you make a function that will have an x and a y

```
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# function for making a circle

f <- function(x, y) {
  x^2 + y^2 - 4.     
}

#cannot be standard form x^2+y^7=4 otherwise the radius would be negative which can't happen


circle_data <- expand_grid(
  x = seq(-3, 3, length.out = 100),
  y = seq(-3, 3, length.out = 100)) |> 
  mutate(z = f(x, y))

ggplot(circle_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_contour(aes(z = z), breaks = 0, color = "red") +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = -10, 10)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = -10:10, limits = -10, 10)+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim= c(-10, 10))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+
  theme_linedraw()

```

standard circle equation is BLAH. cannot write in standard form here otherwise the radius would be negative, which we don't want and can't have lol

We need to make a mini data set. 

we do this with the expand grid thing, we'll use that and name it.

Now we can start
