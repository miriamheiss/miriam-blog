## The Equation


This is called the standard form of a quadratic equation.

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

\ 

You can solve this equation with the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} 
$$

Or by turning it into something that looks like this:

$$
(x + \dots)(x + \dots) = 0
$$
---

But how exactly do you turn this: 

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

into this?: 

$$(x + ...)(x + ...) = 0$$ 


## Noticing a pattern

The first things I noticed were:

- The equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ was easier to solve in this form: $(x + ...)(x + ...) = 0$
- Every problem that I was solving was following a pattern: find $x + b$ and $xc$

Every problem was following this pattern, and eventually turned the quadratic equation into a more manageable equation that looked like this: $(x + ...)(x + ...) = 0$. On question 2 or 3 I started to actually notice the pattern, and now, I had a question.

### The Pattern

The pattern was $y \times z = c$ and $y + z = bx$. The textbook applied it to almost every question for the quadratic equation

### The Question

My question was if there was a pattern, could I apply it to *all* the problems? Would it work if there was no $c$? Would it work if there was no $bx$ I decided to write my question down in a notebook, and test the theory that I had. Would $y \times z = c$ and $y + z = bx$ hold up for all the problems?

## Testing a theory

For the first couple of questions, it worked! Then I came to a very different problem:

$$
56 - x^2 - x = 0
$$

There was no $b$! It was all mixed around and not in the proper form! Would my theory hold up against this?

Yes!

$$
\begin{aligned}
56 - x^2 - x &= 0\\
x^2 + x - 56 &= 0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

I was able to put it into the correct form, but how would I account for the missing *b*? This is essentially what would make or break my theory! Then I remembered that if no coefficient is specified the number is 1! I could now solve the equation! My answer was $x = -7$ and $x = 8$. It had worked!

## My reasoning

- $8 \times -7  = 56$ 
- $8 -7 = 1$.

## More Testing

Now, it worked for questions with both a $bx$ and $c$, either a $bx$ or $c$, and questions with neither. I started to test with made-up questions, not in the textbook, because maybe the questions in the textbook were made to work. The first one was:

$$
x^2 + 7x + 12 = 0 
$$

That worked.

The next problem was:

$$
x^2 + 11x + 28 = 0
$$

That worked too!

I could not seem to find a problem that disproved my theory!

## Using the theory

Here is the easiest way to solve quadratic equations, without using the quadratic formula.

Here is a problem:

$$
x^2 + 9x + 8 = 0
$$

Now, it looks like there is nothing in common between $9x$ and $8$. The numbers that add up to nine are $1 + 8$, $2 + 7$, $3 + 6$, and $5 + 4$. The factors of eight are $2 \times 4$ and $1 \times 8$. The numbers that 9 and 8 have in common are 1 and 8. Those are our two numbers that we need for our more simplified equation. Our new simplified equation is:

$$
(x + 9)(x + 8) = 0
$$

This is much easier to solve than the previous one! Now all we need to do is add the opposite of a positive number, which is a negative number. Our final answer is as such:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(x + 9)(x + 8) &= 0\\
x =& -9\\
x = &-8
\end{aligned}
$$
## Why does $a$ *have* to equal one?

If you do not recall, the equation is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. There is an $a$, $b$, and $c$. The values for $b$ and $c$ are decided by common numbers between the sum and the product of $y + z$ and $y \times z$. But this theory only works when $a = 1$. What happens when $a = 5$? If that happens, $a$ can be split up in many different ways! The theory only works when $a$ cannot be split up. It is still quite a useful way to solve quadratic equations when $a$ is equal to one without using the quadratic formula.
