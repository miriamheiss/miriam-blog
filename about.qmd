Hello there! 

I'm Miriam Heiss! I'm 15 years old and live in Georgia. I'm homeschooled, and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I enjoy crocheting, sewing, knitting, reading and general craft-y things. Some of my favorite books are Six of Crows, The Hunger Games, and These Violent Delights. I rarely bake, but usually enjoy it. 
I also play the organ (which you can see on my YouTube channel), and I have been the organist for my congregation for almost 5 years. Sometimes I compose and arrange, and try to post them on here. You can find all my compositions [here](https://musescore.com/user/48858879).
