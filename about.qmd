Hello there! 

I'm Miriam Heiss! I'm 16 years old and live in Georgia. I'm homeschooled and attending Brigham Young University Idaho as a concurrent enrollment student. I'm also a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I enjoy crocheting, sewing, knitting, reading and general craft-y things. 

I also play the organ (which you can see on my YouTube channel), and I have played the organ for over 7 years. When I have time, I compose and arrange!
