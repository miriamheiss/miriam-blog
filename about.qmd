Hello there! 

I'm Miriam Heiss! I'm 15 years old and live in Georgia. I'm homeschooled, and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 

I enjoy crocheting, sewing, knitting, reading and general craft-y things. 

I also play the organ (which you can see on my YouTube channel), and I have played the organ for over 7 years. Sometimes I compose and arrange, and try to post them on here.
