## Overveiw

I mainly made this blog for my own use just in case I forget something or find something interesting in whatever I am doing at the moment (ie. Math and Coding). This will be a changing and always updating repository, as the blog will keep having new posts. I made it in late July when I was taking a [Data Science Course](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/), and I have been updating it ever since. I will not be posting every day, as posts take a while, but I will try to post 2-3 times a month.
