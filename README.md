## Overveiw

I mainly made this blog for my own use just in case I forget something or find something interesting in whatever I am doing at the moment (ie. Math and Coding). This will be a changing and always updating repository, as the blog will keep having new posts.

## Challenges
###  AKA: YAML is hard

I mainly struggled with the new Quarto YAML settings like `code-fold` and `code-tools` (I get these confused so often), and the spacing (why is it so hard?!).

The hardest thing was the dropdown menu for my project (once more, in YAML), but once I figured it out everything was fine. Learning how to use the terminal was also incredibly difficult.
