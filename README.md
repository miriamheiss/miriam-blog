## Overveiw

I mainly made this blog for my own use just in case I forget something or find something interesting in whatever I am doing at the moment (ie. Math and Coding). This will be a changing and always updating repository, as the blog will keep having new posts. I made it in late July when I was taking a [Data Science Course](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/), and I have been updating it ever since.

## Resources

-   [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) (I'm new to Quarto, I literally can't do anything without this)
-   [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo) (When I do a math post)
-   [Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) (This has a lot of great stuff)
-   [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/minty/) (The theme I used and all its cool things)
-   [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (Where I'm hosting the website)

I use the Bootswatch theme Minty. Bootswatch is built in to Quarto, so in the .yaml you can change the theme to any of the provided bootswatch themes.

I use the code highlighting style espresso in the dark theme, because the colors were similar to the theme of my blog. Espresso is one of the code highlighting options for Pandoc. You can learn more about code highlighting [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#highlighting).

I use Netlify for my website hosting and used to manually push, but I've configured it so I can type `quarto publish` into the terminal and it will publish on its own.

I use MathJax for all of my math posts as it is much easier to type a bunch of stuff into the display and see what it looks like instead of typing things into dollar signs and then see what it looks like.


## Posting

As you can see, I usually take 3 days to a week to work on a post: ![Screen Shot 2022-09-19 at 12 26 22 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110204835/191066261-3b5a1f8d-a543-4221-aefe-c04398f80abc.png)

That's how spaced out the posts are, so I can do 2-5 posts a month, depending on how busy I am and what kind of post I am doing. Travel usually takes longer to write about, while tutorials for R can take 4 hours to a week depending on the workload.
