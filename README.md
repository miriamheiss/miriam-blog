## Overveiw

I mainly made this blog for my own use just in case I forget something or find something interesting in whatever I am doing at the moment (ie. Math and Coding). This will be a changing and always updating repository, as the blog will keep having new posts.


## Resources
### Tabs I have open 24/7

- [Quarto Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo)
- [Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/)
- [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/minty/)

## Challenges
###  AKA: YAML is hard

I mainly struggled with the new Quarto YAML settings like `code-fold` and `code-tools` (I get these confused so often), and the spacing (why is it so hard?!). The hardest thing was the dropdown menu for my project, but once I figured it out everything was fine. Learning how to use the terminal was also incredibly difficult.
