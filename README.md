This is my blog! It doesn't really have a theme of posting (Doesn't only post one sort of thing). I do not have a posting schedule, but I will try for once a month. It has my project for a [class](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/) that I took this year, among other things. 

Here is the blog: <https://www.miriamheiss.com/>
