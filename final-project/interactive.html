<p>The graph below shows the level of energy in Taylor Swift’s songs. The most energetic albums are <strong><em>1989</em></strong>, <strong><em>Speak Now</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Fearless</em></strong>. The least energetic albums are <strong><em>folklore</em></strong> and <strong><em>evermore</em></strong>. Most songs lie between 0.50 and 0.75. She also tends to stick to major keys that are not sharp or flat, like C major, D major, F major, and G major.</p>
